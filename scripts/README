Dependencies to download:

ALL PYTHON:

* python3

* matplotlib

* pandas

* numpy


I think they can all be installed with pip3 install 



Running the test and compilation of data:

python3 test_and_comp.py INI_FILE.ini "increment" OUT.csv


INI_FILE.ini : This is a .ini file found in configs. You do not need to put the path just the name of the ini file

"increment" : Running all our simulations in one go is not a good idea because it will make a huge CSV file. To avoid this
              we can have the simulation numbers in the .ini file to be about 1000 (maybe more is ok) and then we can 
              use the increment field to make more simulations.

              example: if i had the .ini file to be 1000 simulations and i wanted a 1,000,000 simulations i would put:
                        
              python3 test_and_comp.py my.ini 1000 out.csv 

              This is because 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000

OUT.csv : This is simply the name of the csv you want all the output to go




Making graphs:

    To make the graphs simply run:

    python3 graphs.py FILE_name.csv TITLE_NAME

FILE_name.csv: This is simply the name of the file you want graphed, the csv should have been made by test_and_comp.py

TITLE_NAME: The name of the graphs title. This will also be the name of the PNG file, i.e. the graph will be saved as "TITLE_NAME.png"



* NOTE: I knot t_1bit and p_1bit may be confusing for the x labels but trans_1bit and perm_1bti were too long and looked odd *
